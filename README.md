# 🌿 Sendero Sereno (Unity VR) | digital forest bathing

### 🧾 Description
**Immersive VR game experience focused on relaxation and digital forest bathing.**  
Developed in **Unity (C#)** by a team of three students as part of an academic project.  
The game guides players through a series of **3D natural environments**, each designed to evoke a different aspect of relaxation through sound, atmosphere, and interaction.

Players begin in a cozy **main house scene**, where a small **ladybug guide** introduces the purpose of the experience and leads them through three themed environments, each representing a different stage of emotional and sensory relaxation.

The project emphasizes **calm exploration, spatial sound design, and environmental immersion**, designed for **Oculus Quest 2**.

### 🧩 My Contributions
- Authored the **Game Design Document (GDD)**, including gameplay structure, interaction design, visual style, and dialogue scripts used as the foundation for development.  
- Developed the **main environment** and the **lake scene**, focusing on visual composition and interactive flow.  
- Implemented **ambisonic 3D audio** for realistic environmental sound that reacts to player orientation and distance.  
- Programmed **controller inputs and menu functionality** within Unity.  
- Participated in **user testing**, identifying and fixing performance issues and gameplay bugs to optimize performance on Oculus Quest 2.  
- Collaborated with the team using **Git** and **Trello**, with documented design and testing phases.

### 🎮 Gameplay Overview
- 🌲 **Main Scene:** Introduction and guidance from the ladybug character.
